# UEFI Calculator

Our Project is a UEFI Calculator that is capable of basic mathematical operations with a minimal UI.


## Tools
In this section, you should mention the hardware or simulators utilized in your project.
- Qemu
- OVMP
- EDK2


## Implementation Details

In this section, you will explain how you completed your project. It is recommended to use pictures to demonstrate your system model and implementation.


Feel free to use sub-topics for your projects. If your project consists of multiple parts (e.g. server, client, and embedded device), create a separate topic for each one.

## How to Run

To run the application first we need to run EDK2 on top of the QEMU. We have used the following guide to do this and run a simple hello world UEFI app.

Here is a screenshot of running QEMU:

## Results
After successfully running the calculator, we will encounter the following page:

Now we will run some calculations to make sure that our application works fine:
