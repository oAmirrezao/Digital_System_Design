Our Project is a Parking that is capable of handling logic of a special parking for a university.


## Tools
In this section, you should mention the hardware or simulators utilized in your project.
- Modelsim
- Quartus


## Implementation Details

In this section, you will explain how you completed your project. It is recommended to use pictures to demonstrate your system model and implementation.


Feel free to use sub-topics for your projects. If your project consists of multiple parts (e.g. server, client, and embedded device), create a separate topic for each one.

## How to Run

To run the application first download the folder. then open it in modelsim app. then right click on any file and click on the compile all option. wait some seconds. then on top bar of modelsim click on Simulate option and click on start simulation option. then find the work folder and click on the plus next to the work folder. then click on ok and after some seconds add parts which you want to see from view on top bar of modelsim. for examle you can add wave. after that on top bar of modelsim find the Run_all option and click on it. that all.
